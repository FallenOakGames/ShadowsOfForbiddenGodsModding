# ShadowsOfForbiddenGodsModding
This repository contains both the guide for how to mod Shadows, as well as an example mod for you to use as a starting point. The game itself will upload your mod to the Steam Workshop, when you have provided it the necessary files.

Hit 'code' and then 'download' to get all this in a zip file.
